Rotate tetros, then press space to shift tetro all the way down

bug: tetros pop up one pixel when being drawn in the board for the first time
bug: have to click twice to enter NewGame
bug: things get wild when the tetros start filling up the top ~3 rows
bug: blue & purple pieces have errors in one of their alt iterations

abstract tetro/current_piece logic to a new class, things like:
 - get_current_piece_spaces
 - get_current_tetro_alt

has_bottomed should be a CurrentPiece func?
 - I'm inclined to say yes, but it then needs knowledge of the current state of the board
 
has_bottomed & valid_shift check the same things so probably could be combined pretty easily
