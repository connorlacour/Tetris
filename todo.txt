Rotate tetros, then press [somehting] to shift tetro all the way down

bug: have to click twice to enter NewGame
bug: things get wild when the tetros start filling up the top ~3 rows

abstract tetro/current_piece logic to a new class, things like:
 - get_current_piece_spaces
 - get_current_tetro_alt

is_bottomed should be a CurrentPiece func?
 - I'm inclined to say yes, but it then needs knowledge of the current state of the board
 
has_bottomed & valid_shift check the same things so probably could be combined pretty easily
