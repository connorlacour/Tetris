abstract generate_new_piece to tetrominos.py

bug: Have to move mouse to render main menu & have to click twice to enter NewGame

abstract tetro/current_piece logic to a new class, things like:
 - get_current_piece_spaces
 - get_current_tetro_alt

has_bottomed should be a CurrentPiece func?
 - I'm inclined to say yes, but it then needs knowledge of the current state of the board
